# LCD_Investment_Portafolio_Strategies
Final project of a course on investment portfolio strategies in data science.

Portfolio strategies project description

This project aims to make an exploratory analysis of an investment strategy known as Index Replication. 

Index replication is a passive investment strategy that seeks to generate returns similar to the index it seeks to match by fully replicating a market index. Index replication requires the fund to hold shares of all assets in the index and simulate as closely as possible the weight of each one in the index.

I selected an optimal portfolio with the most significant assets in the selected index by reducing the tracking error. Russell 1000 Index was the benchmark chosen. As it was an exploratory project, I decided to do a simulation of its operation within a four-year period from June 2015 to June 2019.

Data was gathered from the Yahoo Finance API.
